## Play

If you're here to play, head to Reboot's homepage on [GitHub Pages](https://rencarothers.github.io/Reboot-Homepage/), it can be played there via desktop browser :grin:

Note: Firefox is reccomended - Chrome is known to lag.  Mobile is not currently supported.  

## Dev Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Unity

This repo requires installation of [Unity 2019.4.18](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2019.4.18), which is currently available for free.  
Unity can be installed via the [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
Use of Unity software may additionally require creating a user account with Unity (also free).

### 2. Clone the Repo

Fork/clone this repository locally.

### 3. Open In Unity

In the Unity Hub, click add and select the local directory you created.  Opening the project will then bring it up in Unity.
It is reccomended that you preserve the project's Unity version and do not update to the current Unity install, if prompted.  
Conversion may cause project files to break.

## Known Issues

One of the project's external asset dependencies, Fungus, may produce Unity meta data file warnings upon importation of the project.  
*Eg. A meta data file (.meta) exists but its asset 'X' can't be found.*
This does not affect the project files themselves. However, if these warnings occur, Unity make take additional time to rebuild the library on first open.
